I like developoing CLI tools with Node.js and different Go libraries, like Gum; this CLI tool is an example of what I can do with it.

I love low-level programming language, compilers and interpreters. I have even designed my own programming language, StarScript, which aims to address some of the things I do not like about other programming languages.

At work, I'm a Senior Sytstem Architect and Software Engineer @Personio.
My team specializes in enabling organizations and departments through technologies and workflows.

I dedicate my time to learn new things and share my knowledge with others.
Programming gives us the opportunity to solve real-life problems and make the world a better place.

I hope I can help you too! `)}
